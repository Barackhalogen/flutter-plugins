# connectivity

This plugin allows Flutter apps to discover network connectivity and configure
themselves accordingly. It can distinguish between cellular vs wifi connection.

Sample usage:

```dart
var connectivityResult = await checkConnectivity();
if (connectivityResult == ConnectivityResult.mobile) {
  // I am connected to a mobile network.
} else if (connectivityResult == ConnectivityResult.wifi) {
  // I am connected to a wifi network.
}
```
