# connectivity_macos

The macos implementation of [`connectivity`].

## Usage

### Import the package


This package has been endorsed, meaning that you only need to add `connectivity`
as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`. It will be automatically included in your app
when you depend on `package:connectivity`.

This is what the above means to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  connectivity: ^0.4.8
  ...
```

If you wish to use the macos package only, you can add  `connectivity_macos` as a
dependency:

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  connectivity_macos: ^0.0.2
  ...
