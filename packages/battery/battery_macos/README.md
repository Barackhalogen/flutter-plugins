# battery_macos

The MacOS implementation of [`battery_macos`][1].

## Usage

### Import the package

This package has not yet been endorsed. Once it is you only need to add
`battery` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`, but for now you
need to include both `battery` and `battery_macos`.

This is what the above means to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  battery_macos: ^1.0.6
  battery_macos: ^0.0.1
  ...
```

[1]: ../battery/battery
