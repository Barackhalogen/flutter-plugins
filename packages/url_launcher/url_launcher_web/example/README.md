# Testing

This package uses `package:integration_test` to run its tests in a web browser.

See [Plugin Tests > Web Tests](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Plugin-Tests#web-tests)
in the Flutter wiki for instructions to setup and run the tests in this package.

Check [flutter.dev > Integration testing](https://flutter.dev/docs/testing/integration-tests)
for more info.

## Mocks

There's `.mocks.dart` files next to the test files that use them.

They're [generated by Mockito](https://github.com/dart-lang/mockito/blob/master/NULL_SAFETY_README.md#code-generation).

Mocks might be manually re-generated with the following command: `flutter pub run build_runner build`. If there are any changes in the mocks, feel free to commit them.

(Mocks will be auto-generated by the `run_test.sh` script as well.)
