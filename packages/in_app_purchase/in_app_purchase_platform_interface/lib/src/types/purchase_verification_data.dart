/// Represents the data that is used to verify purchases.
///
/// The property [source] helps you to determine the method to verify purchases.
/// Different source of purchase has different methods of verifying purchases.
///
/// Both platforms have 2 ways to verify purchase data. You can either choose to verify the data locally using [localVerificationData]
/// or verify the data using your own server with [serverVerificationData].
///
/// For details on how to verify your purchase on iOS,
/// you can refer to Apple's document about [`About Receipt Validation`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH105-SW1).
///
/// On Android, all purchase information should also be verified manually. See [`Verify a purchase`](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_library_overview#Verify).
///
/// It is preferable to verify purchases using a server with [serverVerificationData].
///
/// If the platform is iOS, it is possible the data can be null or your validation of this data turns out invalid. When this happens,
/// Call [InAppPurchaseConnection.refreshPurchaseVerificationData] to get a new [PurchaseVerificationData] object. And then you can
/// validate the receipt data again using one of the methods mentioned in [`Receipt Validation`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH105-SW1).
