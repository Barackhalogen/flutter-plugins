# Testing

This package uses `package:integration_test` to run its tests in a web browser.

See [Plugin Tests > Web Tests](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Plugin-Tests#web-tests)
in the Flutter wiki for instructions to setup and run the tests in this package.

Check [flutter.dev > Integration testing](https://flutter.dev/docs/testing/integration-tests)
for more info.

## Mocks

There's new `.mocks.dart` files next to the test files that use them.

Mock files are [generated by `package:mockito`](https://github.com/dart-lang/mockito/blob/master/NULL_SAFETY_README.md#code-generation). The contents of these files can change with how the mocks are used within the tests, in addition to actual changes in the APIs they're mocking.

Mock files can be updated either manually by running the following command: `flutter pub run build_runner build` (or the `regen_mocks.sh` script), or automatically on each call to the `run_test.sh` script.

Please, add whatever changes show up in mock files to your PRs, or CI will fail.
